# Pages

Next.js uses [pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) to automatically creates [routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction) for any file created inside
it.

Here, we have a custom [\_app](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app), [\_document](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document),
[404](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page#404-page) pages. We also have an index.js as the
landing page and [chapter].js page the [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).
